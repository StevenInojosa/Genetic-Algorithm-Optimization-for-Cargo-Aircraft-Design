# Genetic-Algorithm-Optimization-for-Cargo-Aircraft-Design
The preliminary design of the cargo aircraft is sought to be optimized by integrating different disciplines and automating the initial stage of the process to meet the competition's deadlines. The goal is to maximize the estimated score of the prototype and meet the established design requirements.
